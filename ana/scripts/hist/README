	purpose:
		the h_cluster class
		histogram module for the cluster candidate events

	    This program creates :
		one dimensional histograms
		two dimensional histograms
		a memory-resident ntuple for variables in the cluster Class
	    These objects are filled with variables in the cluster Class and saved on a rootfile
        Functions: 
            def __init__(): 
	    	initial histogrmas / ntuple

	    def Fill(self, cluster): 
	        fill histograms/ntuple from the input cluster event
