   @@@ problems / questions to check in current run:
     1. check why this image has a sstd = 835 for the bias medium data

   @@@ data sanity check:
      1. plot the mean & sstd of bias images as a function of time

   @@@ features to add for future runs: 
     -- There are days with less than 5 bias files taken for each CCD, for example data of 20161224: each det has only 
        4 bias files. Modify python analyse code to take in data with less than 5 bias data files
     1. dump Overscan region stat info to output for future analysis, such as checking device stability 
     2. check if stat.dat & pixelList.dat both exist, if so, don't need to rerun the raw data file

   @@@ data sanity check:
   1. hot-strip removal: see hot-strip events in cluster candidate
   events. Need to check:
     a. hot-strip removal algorithm
     b. which mean/sstd to use when subtracting bias? Since there are
     hotstrip/hotcells and CR events on individual images, maybe it is
     better to use the MEDIAM image's mean/sstd for bias subtraction?
     In run1, the mean/sstd of the individual image are used. 
     c. Check the residuel image:
       in hot-strip event, pV(raw) = O(26000), how can I get a pV(net) ~
       O(500) in a candidate event? 
     d. example event:
